# Keylogger

## About Code:

The method of capturing (logging) the keys pushed on a keyboard is known as _keystroke logging_ (usually captured when the user is unaware).

It can be used for malicious purposes like _stealing passwords_, it is more frequently used to _track network activity_.

A keylogger for Windows computers is being demonstrated in this specific Python program. It records the user's keystrokes and puts them in a file with the name **keylogger logs.txt** .
